Download multiple original size images at once from a single article page on dgtle.com, and put the images under folder named by author's ID.

I used to enjoy the beautiful photos taken by various photographer all over world (mainly from CHina), however, it is painful to save each of them.
Trying to search if there is exising program available, but with no luck.
So I have to pick up the books and start from zero to build my wheels.
It definately not the best solution on Internet, I want to share a story that I learned years ago from textbook:
saying the scientist Einstain once in the school, and he had a hard time to build hand crafted object, and was laughed by his classmate. 
His teacher asked, is there anything could be worse than this ugly thing?
He nodded his head, and show him two previous prototypes he was tried earlier.

I'm still a beginner for programming, but I believe, one day I will be better.

Hope you enjoy the code.
