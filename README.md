# Dgtle-downloader

Download multiple original size images at once from a single article page on dgtle.com, and put the images under a folder named by the author's ID.

I used to enjoy the beautiful photos taken by various photographers all over the world (mainly from CHina), however, it is painful to save each of them.
Trying to search if there is an existing program available, but with no luck.
So I have to pick up the books and start from zero to build my wheels.
It is definitely not the best solution on the Internet, I want to share a story that I learned years ago from a textbook:
saying the scientist Einstein once in the school, and he had a hard time to build hand crafted objects, and was laughed at by his classmate.
His teacher asked, is there anything worse than this ugly thing?
He nodded his head, and showed him two previous prototypes he had tried earlier.

I'm still a beginner in programming, but I believe one day I will be better.

Hope you enjoy the code.
